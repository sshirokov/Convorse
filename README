Convorse is a Convore client library.

#TODO: Description

WARNING:
        This is stupidly early code.  As of writing only GET requests work, and the streaming interface isn't 
        yet wired correctly.  This only proves that the API is compiled to the correct call chains.

Quick Demo:

 This demo will spin up the API, authenticated by the user/pass combo on the command line and launch into a repl.
 The context will contain 'client' which is an instance of the library and 'callback' a generic callback
 to output the result of a request.  It has the signature callback(error, data).
